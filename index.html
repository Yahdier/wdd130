        <img src="images/profile.webp" alt="Hello, my name is Yahdier Díaz" width="200">
        <p>Hello! My name is Yahdier Díaz and I am from San Juan Puerto Rico. I been marry for 6 years. I am a member of
            The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I got baptized when I was 18 years old. I am the only
            member in my family besides my wife.
            I served my mission in the Nevada Las Vegas West mission from 2012-2014.I love to serve in the church. I
            love to help others and I love to learn new things. My favorite food is pasta. I love to watch movies, spent
            time with friends and family. I love to play video games, board games and I also love and enjoy watching
            Formula 1. I also love to play and watch basketball (NBA).
            I have never work or study before anything from software development. I currently work as a full-time
            employee in a call center. I have a bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a concentration in
            Human Resources.
            I only have 6 months experience in Human Resources and I decide that I needed something that can fill me. I
            am now a student of BYU Pathway Worldwide and I am grateful for the opportunity to study and learn about
            HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, software development and any other related area.</p>
